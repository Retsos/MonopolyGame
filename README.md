This application was developed as part of the work for the course "Human-Machine Interaction" of the 5th semester of the School of Computer Engineering and Electronic Systems at the Hellenic University.

This is an implementation of a board game inspired by the classic Monopoly, designed to combine fun and strategy. The application allows players to interact with the board, manage properties, make decisions related to buying and selling, and face challenges through dynamic game mechanics.
